# Speech Analysis Setup Guide

## Why Transcription is Wrong

The transcription is currently using **simulation mode** because no Hugging Face API key is configured. This means you're getting random, hardcoded transcriptions instead of real speech recognition.

## How to Fix Transcription Accuracy

### Option 1: Enable Real Speech Recognition (Recommended)

1. **Get a Hugging Face API Key:**
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
   - Create a new token with "Read" permissions
   - Copy the token

2. **Add the API Key:**
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the project root
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_token_here`
   - Restart the development server

3. **Benefits:**
   - Real speech-to-text transcription
   - Accurate slurred speech detection
   - Better confidence scoring

### Option 2: Use Current Simulation (Already Improved)

The simulation has been improved with:
- More realistic transcriptions
- Better confidence scoring
- Proper slurred speech detection
- 70% normal speech, 30% slurred speech ratio

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Simulation Mode**: Working with improved accuracy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Real Speech Recognition**: Requires API key setup
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to simulation

## Testing

1. Click the "üé§ Voice Analysis" button
2. Record your speech
3. Check the console for "Using speech analysis simulation" or "Real speech analysis result"
4. Review the transcription accuracy

## Troubleshooting

- If you see "Using speech analysis simulation" ‚Üí No API key configured
- If you see "Real speech analysis result" ‚Üí Real AI transcription working
- If transcription is still wrong ‚Üí Check audio quality and speak clearly
